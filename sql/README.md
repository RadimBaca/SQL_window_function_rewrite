# SQL scripts

Here is a set of directories with the SQL scripts used:
- **agg_test** - Aggregate microbenchmark templates. Contains init scripts that need to be run on a database before the microbenchmark.
- **rank_test** - Greatest per group microbenchmark templates.
- **tpch** - TPC-H queries.
- **unittests** - Some sample scripts that were used during the unit testing of the SQL rewriting tool.
